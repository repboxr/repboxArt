      is_first: The variable is the first explanatory variable in the regression formula.
      is_endo: The variable is an endogeneous variable in an IV regression.
      is_interaction: |
        The variable seems to be an interaction effect. In some instances that may be good indicator,
        e.g. in a DID regression.
      is_only_interaction: |
        The variable is indeed the only variable that can be shown to be an interaction effect.
        It is less common to control for interaction effects, so this might be an
        indicator to be the variable of interest.
