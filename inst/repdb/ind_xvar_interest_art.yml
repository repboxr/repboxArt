    descr: Type of the the indicator as explained below
    val_descr:
      llm_gpt4: An llm suggests that this is the variable of interest.
      is_only: The variable is the only shown explanatory variable.
      is_first: The variable is the first explanatory variable in the regression formula.
      is_interaction: |
        The variable seems to be an interaction effect. In some instances that may be good indicator,
        e.g. in a DID regression.
      is_only_interaction: |
        The variable is indeed the only variable that can be shown to be an interaction effect.
        It is less common to control for interaction effects, so this might be an
        indicator to be the variable of interest.
