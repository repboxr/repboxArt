# Fields with one entry per regression

name: art_regcoef

descr: |
  Information about extracted coefficients and standard errors from regression tables.
unique_index:
  main_index: [artid, regid, coef_pos]

fields:
  artid:
    descr: ID of the article that is analyzed.

  regid:
    descr: |
      Number of the regression in the article.
    type: int

  coef_pos:
    descr: |
      Position of the shown coefficient.
    type: int

  label:
    descr: |
      The label before the coefficient. We refer to it as xlabel
      as it typically refers to the explanatory variable.

  coef:
    descr: |
      Numerical value of the coefficient. The art_ is used to better match
      with coefficients from supplements.
    type: num

  paren:
    descr: |
      Numerical value of the value in (parenthesis). Typically the standard error,
      but could also be something different.
    type: num

  coef_num_str:
    descr: |
      The coefficient as string. Compared to art_coef this allows us to
      verifiy the exact number of shown digits.

  paren_num_str:
    descr: |
      The number shown in parentheses as string. Compared to art_coef this allows us to
      verifiy the exact number of shown digits.

  coef_str:
    descr: |
      The complete string in the coefficient cell. Can include significance stars.

  paren_str:
    descr: |
      The complete string in the parenthesis cell. Includes () and may include significance stars.

  stars_str:
    descr: |
      Significance stars string.

  coef_num_deci:
    descr: Number of decimal digits shown for coef
    type: int

  paren_num_deci:
    descr: Number of decimal digits shown for number in parenthesis
    type: int

  coef_cellid:
    type: int

  paren_cellid:
    type: int
