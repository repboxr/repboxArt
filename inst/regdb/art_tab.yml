  tabid:
    descr: |
      Number of the table as in the article, e.g. a "4" for "Table 4" or an "A1" for Table "A1".

  tabpos:
    descr: |
      The position of the table in the article. When generating HTML files,
      we will use tabpos instead of tabid as index, because an integer
      is more reliable and smaller.

      Like "Table 4 â€” Multivariate Dprobit Regression of Tax Refund Savings Intent on Demographic"

  num_panels:
    descr: |
      Number of panels for this table.

  pdf_file:
    descr: PDF file where the panel can be found. Empty if only parsed from HTML.

  html_file:
    descr: HTML file where the panel can be found. Empty if only parsed from PDF.

  url_org_tab:
    descr: |
      URL for original version of the table. If the table is extracted from
      a PDF, we try to link directly to the page on which the tab is shown.
      In an HTML file we try to directly link to the table if possible (depends
      on whether the HTML page has a proper ID for the table).
